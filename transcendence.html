    <h2 align="center">Prelude</h2>
    <p>Robots are neat. Really neat. The birth of automata goes back thousands of years and across many cultures. Early attempts were made to create self-operating machines, but it would only be in the last few hundred years that we would see machines at their true potential. One of my favourite examples is WABOT-2. Created in 1980, the machine was designed to play musical scores, as well as play an electronic keyboard. It sported a camera for a head, able to read said scores, and five-fingers which could deliver precise movements. This is only one of many examples, but WABOT-2 would definitely pave the way for the machines of the future.<br/>

    <p>
      In a lot of media, robots are often viewed as soulless, godless pieces of metal with no sense of morality, incapable of feeling emotions. This depiction of robots can be harmful, as it causes humanity to be fearful of robots. The idea that a machine can’t have emotions or a soul is simply a baseless claim, further fueled by these types of depictions. Few pieces of media go over the impact on society sentient robots would have, the eventual fight for robot rights or robots and religion. All of these would serve as great stories to tell and to prepare the future generations for what’s to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads to the main point of this document and that would be what we can call <b>Robot-Identified People</b>.
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">What exactly are Robot-Identified People?</h2>
    <p>
      Simply put, they are people who identify as machines/robots, either partially or completely. There are a few labels that one could use, so let’s go over each one.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Robotkin</h3>
    <p>
      Robotkin is used to describe someone who identifies as a robot and feels a connection to robots, that they have a soul of a robot or that they were a robot in a future life. It is a part of the larger otherkin umbrella.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Otherkin</h3>
    <p>
      An identity that is described as being something nonhuman, whether mentally, spiritually or otherwise. This has many specified branches.<br/>Contrary to popular belief, the Otherkin community <a href="http://frameacloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Scribner_Timeline2p0.pdf">predates Tumblr and the internet</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Machinekin</h3>
    <p>
      An umbrella term that encompasses Robotkin, Androidkin, Programkin, Aikin and some Objectkin and Fictionkin.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Androidkin</h3>
    <p>
      Another label similar to Robotkin and Machinekin. Androids tend to be more lifelike than robots and may appear near-human despite not being such. A good example might be Data from Star Trek or David⁸ from Prometheus.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">AIkin</h3>
    <p>
      AIkin is used to describe people who identify as AI in some fashion and feel a connection towards AI. They may describe being without form, something more inside of a chassis as opposed to connected to it.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Robotgender</h3>
    <p>
      Robotgender is a xenogender identity used to describe someone who feels their gender is heavily connected to robots. While there is some overlap with Robotkin, they are <b>not</b> the same. A person who is robotgender does not strictly have to identify as a robot, and inversely a robot does not have to identify as robotgender- though they can be both.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some of the more common labels, though it is not limited to these.
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">Debunking the "Soul Argument"</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, machinekin (and other non-therian) individuals in particular have been marginalized as a result of the "soul argument". Simply put, the argument states that you cannot identify as something that lacks a soul. The previously mentioned view of robots as soulless beings results in some parts of the otherkin community dismissing the kintype altogether and/or not taking it seriously, which leaves robotkin without support networks and virtually nothing to fall back on.
    </p>
    <p>The soul argument relies on arbitrary ideas of what has a soul or not. Regardless of what you believe, there simply isn't any scientific evidence that supports the existence of souls, so it's safe to assume they don't really matter. Simply put, <b>if you identify as something, then that something is what you are, not something you have to prove.</b>
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">How did you come to identify as a robot?</h2>
    <p>
      There are many reasons why you might want to become a robot and identify as them. Many of us are neurodivergent and our minds may feel more connected to machines and other non-human beings. Below, let’s look at some of the things that may have led to your robot identity.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Fear of death</h3>
    <p>
      There is simply not enough time to do very much in the body you currently reside in. Becoming a robot would remove any of that worry, as you would no longer grow old. It would allow you to do more things.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Discomfort with your current body</h3>
    <p>
      Underlying medical conditions can fill your life with inconveniences and pain. Additionally, you may feel discomfort with many of your body's characteristics, such as visible veins, heartbeats, random pains, itching, fatigue, facial/body hair or even skin itself. Becoming a robot would remove the worry from these things.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Feeling non-human</h3>
    <p>
      The inability to relate with humanity or your body very well. You may feel more logic-oriented, unable to relate with other humans or simply discomfort of the body itself.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Closeness to machines and computers</h3>
    <p>
      You may have an incredible fascination with technology, old and new alike. Completing tech projects or just messing with bare electronics can help you feel more in touch with your inner machine.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Relating to robots in media</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of modern day media is geared towards neurotypicals, but many robotkin are neurodivergent. You may find that robots relate to you more, with some reasons being that your brain is more logic-oriented like a robot or even feeling emotionless like how the media depicts robots.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Feeling in control</h3>
    <p>
      In youth, you may have had traumatic experiences where you were defenceless. Being in a robot body could give you a feeling of being in control in tough situations.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Modularity</h3>
    <p>
      You may enjoy the idea of being able to modify your body to your own liking, something that cannot be done with flesh. You can look as your ideal self and switch out parts whenever you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may feel at least one or more of these experiences. Becoming a robot would take away a lot of the worries in your life and allow you to achieve your true and full potential.
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">What types of media helped you discover your robotness?</h2>

    </p>

    <h2 align="center">What are some things you do to alleviate species dysphoria?</h2>
    <p>
      This varies depending on who you are, but here are a few things you could do to feel more comfortable in the body you currently reside in.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Covering skin</h3>
    <p>
      Covering skin is just one of the ways to help you feel comfortable. Wearing gloves to cover hands or long sleeve shirts to cover arms are some of the few things you may do. Wearing clothing with neutral, monochrome colors can help as well.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Wearing masks, helmets or electronics</h3>
    <p>
      Wearing masks and helmets can help you feel more in line with a machine. Such objects may include gas masks, LED masks, TV and monitor shells or even glasses. Electronic devices such as watches and headphones may also help.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Robot-friendly language</h3>
    <p>
      You may opt to use it/its pronouns, as it helps distance yourself from humans. You may also switch out human terms for ones more inline with computers. See <a href="glossary.html">here</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Voice Changer</h3>
    <p>
      A voice changer for use in online voice calls may help you feel more comfortable and feel more like a machine.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Performing repetitive tasks or chores</h3>
    <p>
      Robots are often viewed as performing daily tasks that a human might not want to do. Doing laundry, filling out forms or cleaning are some of the things that can help with that. Some therians call this tasking, as with giving an animal a job to do. Having a directive may help with boredom and make you feel useful.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Partaking in media</h3>
    <p>
      Media such as books, video games, films, music and TV shows that feature robots (examples shown above) can help bring you into a robot headspace and bring us a great deal of yearning and euphoria. Video games with playable robots, as well as Virtual Reality, help a great deal.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Working with technology</h3>
    <p>
      Messing around with electronics, programming and completing tech projects can help you dive into your inner robot.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some of the many examples of the things you may do to feel more robotic and more inline with your machine self.
