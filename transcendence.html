    <h2 align="center">Prelude</h2>
    <p align="center">Robots are neat. Really neat. The birth of automata goes back thousands of years and across many cultures. Early attempts were made to create self-operating machines, but it would only be in the last few hundred years that we would see machines at their true potential. One of my favourite examples is WABOT-2. Created in 1980, the machine was designed to play musical scores, as well as play an electronic keyboard. It sported a camera for a head, able to read said scores, and five-fingers which could deliver precise movements. This is only one of many examples, but WABOT-2 would definitely pave the way for the machines of the future.<br/>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      In a lot of media, robots are often viewed as soulless, godless pieces of metal with no sense of morality, incapable of feeling emotions. This depiction of robots can be harmful, as it causes humanity to be fearful of robots. The idea that a machine can’t have emotions or a soul is simply a baseless claim, further fueled by these types of depictions. Few pieces of media go over the impact on society sentient robots would have, the eventual fight for robot rights or robots and religion. All of these would serve as great stories to tell and to prepare the future generations for what’s to come.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      This leads us to the main point of this document and that would be what we can call <b>Robot-Identified People</b>.
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">Who and what are Robot-Identified People?</h2>
    <p align="center">
      Simply put, we are people who identify as machines/robots, either partially or completely. There are a few labels that one could use, so let’s go over each one.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Robotkin</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Robotkin is used to describe someone who identifies as a robot and feels a connection to robots, that they have a soul of a robot or that they were a robot in a future life. It is a part of the larger otherkin umbrella.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Otherkin</h3>
    <p align="center">
      An identity that is described as being something nonhuman, whether mentally, spiritually or otherwise. This has many specified branches.<br/>Contrary to popular belief, the Otherkin community <a href="http://frameacloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Scribner_Timeline2p0.pdf">predates Tumblr and the internet</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Machinekin</h3>
    <p align="center">
      An umbrella term that encompasses Robotkin, Androidkin, Programkin, Aikin and some Objectkin and Fictionkin.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Androidkin</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Another label similar to Robotkin and Machinekin. Androids tend to be more lifelike than robots and may appear near-human despite not being such. A good example might be Data from Star Trek or David⁸ from Prometheus.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">AIkin</h3>
    <p align="center">
      AIkin is used to describe people who identify as AI in some fashion and feel a connection towards AI. They may describe being without form, something more inside of a chassis as opposed to connected to it.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Robotgender</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Robotgender is a xenogender identity used to describe someone who feels their gender is heavily connected to robots. While there is some overlap with Robotkin, they are <b>not</b> the same. A person who is robotgender does not strictly have to identify as a robot, and inversely a robot does not have to identify as robotgender- though they can be both.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      These are some of the more common labels, though it is not limited to these.
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">Debunking the "Soul Argument"</h2>
    <p align="center">
      Unfortunately machinekin (and other non-therian) individuals in particular have been marginalized due to the "soul argument", which states that you cannot be something that lacks a soul. The previously mentioned view of robots as lacking a soul results in some parts of the otherkin community dismissing the kintype altogether and/or not taking it seriously, which hurts us a lot, as it leaves us without support networks and nothing to fall back on.
    </p>
    <p align="center">The soul argument relies on arbitraty ideas of what has a soul or not. Regardless of whatever you believe, there simply isn't any scientific evidence that supports the existence of souls, so it's safe to assume they don't really matter. Simply put, <b>if you identify as something, then that something is what you are, not something you have to prove.</b>
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">How did you come to identify as robots?</h2>
    <p align="center">
      There are many reasons why we want to become robots and identify as them. Many of us are neurodivergent and our minds feel more connected to machines than they do with humans. Below, let’s look at some of the things that led to our robot identity.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Fear of death</h3>
    <p align="center">
      There is simply not enough time to do very much in the bodies we currently reside in. Becoming robots would kill any of that worry, as we would no longer grow old. It would allow us to do more things.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Discomfort with our current bodies</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Underlying medical conditions can fill our lives with inconveniences and pain. Additionally, some of us feel discomfort with many of our body's characteristics, such as visible veins, heartbeats, random pains, itching, fatigue, facial/body hair or even skin itself. Becoming a robot would remove the worry from these things.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Feeling non-human</h3>
    <p align="center">
      The inability to relate with humanity or our bodies very well. We may feel more logic-oriented, unable to relate with other humans or simply discomfort of the body itself.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Closeness to machines and computers</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Many of us have an incredible fascination with technology, old and new alike. Completing tech projects or just messing with bare electronics can help us feel more in touch with our inner machine.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Relating to robots in media</h3>
    <p align="center">
      A lot of modern day media is geared towards neurotypicals, but many of us robots are neurodivergent. Many of us find that robots relate to us more, with some reasons being that our brains are more logic-oriented like a robot or even feeling emotionless like how the media depicts robots.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Feeling in control</h3>
    <p align="center">
      In youth, some of us may have had traumatic experiences where we were defenseless. Being in a robot body would give us a feeling of being in control.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Modularity</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Many of us enjoy the idea of being able to modify our bodies to our own liking, something that cannot be done with flesh. We can look as our ideal selves and switch out parts whenever we want.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      Many of us feel at least one or more of these experiences. Becoming a robot would take away a lot of the worries in our lives and allow us to achieve our true and full potential.
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">What types of media helped you discover your robotness?</h2>
    <p align="center">
      While not every robot person has been affected by the media, here are some examples of media that helped some of us discover our robotness.

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      These serve as a few examples, but of course, other pieces of media exist that might not be listed here. Many of this media helped us realize our machine identity and cement it.
    </p>
  <hr/>
    <h2 align="center">What are some things you do to alleviate species dysphoria?</h2>
    <p align="center">
      This varies from robot to robot, but here are a few things many of us do to feel more comfortable in the bodies we currently reside in.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Covering skin</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Covering skin is just one of the ways to help us feel comfortable. Wearing gloves to cover hands or long sleeve shirts to cover arms are some of the few things we may do. Wearing clothing with neutral colors such as white, black and grey can help as well.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Wearing masks, helmets or electronics</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Wearing masks and helmets can help us feel more in line with a machine. Such objects may include gas masks, LED masks, TV and monitor shells or even glasses. Electronic devices such as watches and headphones may also help.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Robot-friendly language</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Many of us opt to use it/its pronouns, as it helps distance ourselves from humans. We may also switch out human terms for ones more inline with computers. See the "beep" or "Glossary of Robot-Friendly Language" section of this site for more information.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Voice Changer</h3>
    <p align="center">
      A voice changer for use in online voice calls may help us feel more comfortable and feel more like a machine.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Performing repetitive tasks or chores</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Robots are often viewed as performing daily tasks that a human might not want to do. Doing laundry, filling out forms or cleaning are some of the things that can help with that. Some therians call this tasking, as with giving an animal a job to do. Having a directive makes robots feel useful, or helps deal with boredom.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Partaking in media</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Media such as books, video games, films, music and TV shows that feature robots can help bring us into a robot headspace and thus, bring us a great deal of yearning and euphoria. Video games with playable robots, as well as Virtual Reality, help a great deal.
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Working with technology</h3>
    <p align="center">
      Messing around with electronics, programming and completing tech projects can help us dive into our inner robot.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      These are some of the many examples of the things we do to feel more robotic and more inline with our machine selves.
    </p>

    <h2 align="center">Resources</h2>
    <p align="center">
      We also have some resources to help our fellow machines! Hopefully, you find these informative and useful!
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      P0LYB1UZ runs <a href="https://www.machinesoul.net/">a website</a> dedicated to bringing awareness about machinekin. Additionally, it has nonfiction and fictional robot writing available to read.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      For machines who like using robot-friendly language, a compiled list of possible robot terms can be found <a href="/glossary.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      Thank you for taking your time to read this document. I hope you all found it informative and I sincerely hope it helps other machines trying to find themselves. You need all the support you can get and we’re here for you.
